# HUMAN POSE ESTIMATION FOR DIABETES DISORDER USING DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUE

Introduction

Human pose estimation (HPE), which has been extensively studied in computer vision literature, involves estimating the configuration of human body parts from input data captured by sensors, in particular images and videos. HPE provides geometric and motion information of the human body which has been applied to a wide range of applications (e.g., human-computer interaction, motion analysis, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), healthcare, etc.). With the rapid development of deep learning solutions in recent years, such solutions have been shown to outperform classical computer vision methods in various tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation and object detection. 

Problem statement

DIABETES:

Diabetes is a condition which affects a person's metabolic system as the glucose level rises because of inadequate insulin production or due to the insufficient response of the body to insulin.

Symptoms: Hunger and fatigue, peeing more often and being thirstier, dry mouth and itchy skin, blurred vision.

Yoga is the best way to adjust your blood sugar levels to normal. Yoga keeps your stress level low, protects against cardiac diseases, prevents diabetic neuropathy, and boosts strength and balance to promote overall health.
